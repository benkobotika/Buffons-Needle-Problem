# Buffon's Needle Problem

* The simulation of the **Buffon’s Needle Problem** is about dropping
needles on a lined surface and determining the probability of the needles
crossing one of the lines.

* It's a great method for approximating the number `π`.

## How to call the function?

`needle(d, l, n, nr_needles, nr_lines);`
* d - distance between lines
* l - the length of the needles
* n - the number of dropped needles
* nr_needles - the number of dropped needles visually displayed on the screen
* nr_lines - the number of lines
